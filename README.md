# An Introduction to Computational Macroeconomics (Tokyo 2022)

* Lecturer: John Stachurski
* Lecture times: Wednesdays 3 and 4 periods (13:00-16:40).
* Start date: 8/6/2022

## Overview

This course provides a short but fast-moving introduction to computational
modeling in macroeconomics and finance.  Topics include numerical methods and
their application to workhorse models in macroeconomics, such as Markov
chains, asset pricing problems and dynamic programming.
