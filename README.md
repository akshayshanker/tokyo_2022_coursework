An Introduction to Computational Macroeconomics (U Tokyo 2022)

This course provides a short but fast-moving introduction to computational modeling in macroeconomics and finance.  Topics include numerical methods and their application to workhorse models in macroeconomics, such as Markov chains, asset pricing problems and dynamic programming.

1. Scientific programming in Python
2. Foundations of numerical methods
3. Job search
4. Fixed point theory in vector space
5. Finite Markov chains
6. Finite Markov decision processes
7. Applications: optimal savings and investment
8. Recursive decision processes
9. Recursive preferences
10. State-dependent dynamic programming
11. Optimal savings in a general setting
12. Euler equation methods
