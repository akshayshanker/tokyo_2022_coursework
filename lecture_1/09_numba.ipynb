    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In an earlier lecture we learned about vectorization, which is one method to improve speed and efficiency in numerical work.\n",
    "\n",
    "Vectorization involves sending array processing operations in batch to efficient low-level code.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, vectorization has several weaknesses.\n",
    "\n",
    "One is that it is highly memory-intensive when working with large amounts of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another is that the set of algorithms that can be entirely vectorized is not universal.\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, for some algorithms, vectorization is ineffective.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, a Python library called [Numba](http://numba.pydata.org/) solves many of these problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "It does so through something called **just in time (JIT) compilation**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key idea is to compile functions to native machine code instructions on the fly.\n",
    "\n",
    "When it succeeds, the compiled code is extremely fast.\n",
    "\n",
    "This lecture introduces the main ideas.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "As stated above, Numba's primary use is compiling functions to fast native\n",
    "machine code during runtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "### An Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider a problem that is difficult to vectorize: generating the trajectory of a difference equation given an initial condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will take the difference equation to be the quadratic map\n",

    "\n",
    "Numba attempts to generate fast machine code using the infrastructure provided by the [LLVM Project](http://llvm.org/).\n",
    "\n",
    "It does this by inferring type information on the fly.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic idea is this:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Python is very flexible and hence we could call the function qm with many\n",
    "  types.\n",
    "    * e.g., `x0` could be a NumPy array or a list, `n` could be an integer or a float, etc.\n",
    "* This makes it hard to *pre*-compile the function.\n",
    "* However, when we do actually call the function, say by executing `qm(0.5, 10)`,\n",
    "  the types of `x0` and `n` become clear.\n",
    "* Moreover, the types of other variables in `qm` can be inferred once the input is known.\n",
    "* So the strategy of Numba and other JIT compilers is to wait until this\n",
    "  moment, and *then* compile the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "That's why it is called \"just-in-time\" compilation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that, if you make the call `qm(0.5, 10)` and then follow it with `qm(0.9, 20)`, compilation only takes place on the first call.\n",
    "\n",
    "The compiled code is then cached and recycled as required.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Decorators and \"nopython\" Mode\n",
    "\n",
    "In the code above we created a JIT compiled version of `qm` via the call"

    "\n",
    "When Numba cannot infer all type information, some Python objects are given generic object status and execution falls back to the Python runtime.\n",
    "\n",

    "We generally prefer to force an error when this occurs, so we know effective\n",
